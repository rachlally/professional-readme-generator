# Professional README Generator

A professional README generator for the developer in need

## Description

Following the completion of a big project, some developers may dread the (actual) last task: creating a README file.  It takes time to compile the correct information, to create the layout, and then save to the repo.  However, creating a professional, high-quality README is critical for long term success of an application.  

The Professional README Generator helps streamline this process.  With the command-line application, it is easy to integrate into any project.  The application prompts users through a series of questions so they spend less time looking up README requirements and more time enjoying their finished product. 

I learned more about node.js and using the command-line.  I learned how to link in packages from npm.  I also dove further into README's including installation, tests, and license options.

## Installation

For installation, fork the repository to your local machine and add to desired project: https://github.com/rachlally/professional-readme-generator .

## Usage

Pull the repository to your local machine:  https://github.com/rachlally/professional-readme-generator 

Once installed, navigate to the command-line, enter: 

```bash
node index.js
```  

You will be asked a series of questions.  Include detailed responses for the generator.  Following the last prompt, a README.md will be added to your local machine.  The README generated follows all recommended guidelines and will include your input from the command-line.
